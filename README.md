## <u>How it works</u>
I have developed an online book search engine, which is linked to google books API. This application enables users to create an account, search for books and add books to saved lists. When you open the application, you will be greeted with a message asking you to search for a book. Users also have the option to login/signup in the navigation bar.
This application was initially done with restFUL API using the express server, however i refractored the code to use GraphQL and Apollo Server. By leveraging the power of React, MongoDB, ExpressJS, and Node.js (MERN), I successfully built an application that combines a robust frontend framework, a scalable NoSQL database, and a versatile backend server to deliver a seamless and dynamic user experience.

## <u>Technologies used</u>
**JavaScript:** The main programming language used for developing the app's logic and interactivity.

**HTML:** The standard markup language utilized for structuring the web pages and content of the weather app.

**React** JavaScript library for building the user interface, providing a component-based architecture and efficient rendering to create an interactive and scalable web application.

**Custom CSS Styling:** Custom CSS styling has been applied to enhance the visual appeal.

**MongoDB** NoSQL database that allows for flexible data modeling and seamless integration with other application stacks.

**ExpressJS** Employed as the web application framework to handle routing and middleware operations for our e-commerce API.

**Node.js:** Utilized as the runtime environment to execute JavaScript code on the server-side for seamless integration with the frontend.

**Apollo Server** A robust and flexible GraphQL server implementation that enables seamless integration of GraphQL into my application stack.

**GraphQL** A powerful query language and runtime that allowed me to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data from various sources and provides a flexible and intuitive approach to building APIs.


## <u>Installation</u>
This application offers the convenience of being a web-based platform, eliminating the need for downloads. Simply visit the website to access its features directly. Alternatively, if you wish to test or modify the application, you can clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and execute the commands "npm run build" followed by "npm run develop" to compile and launch the application locally.
